git status
 - Shows changes that are staged for commit
 - Shows changes that are not staged for commit (you can stage files for commit with "git add <file>")
 - Shows Untracked files that are not in the repository (you can add them to the repo with "git add <file>")

A commit is like a submited changelist.

The staging environment (used to be called the index) represents the files that will be included in the next commit, much like a pending changelist.
 - "git add <file>" to stage a new/modified file for commit
 - add any other changed files that you want to submit (commit) at the same time

Staged files are not in a commit yet!

Once all the changes files have been added to the staging environment you can add them to a commit them with "git commit"
 - git commit -m "This is a description of my commit!"
 - The committed files are not yet in the remote repository!
 - Your local branch is now ahead of "origin/master" by 1 commit.
 - You can make further commits to the local branch as needed.

git log
 - Shows the commit logs

To show the files contained within a commit:
 - "git show --stat --oneline HEAD"
 - "git show --name-only --oneline HEAD"

This shows the latest commit. To view a different commit, replace HEAD with the SHA1 hash of the commit (get from git log)

To work on a new feature without affecting the main project, create a branch:
 - "git checkout -b <my branch name>" creates a new branch and automatically 'checks you out' on it.
 - "git branch" to display all the branches and indicate which one you are in.

To push changes:
 - "git push"
 - "git push origin"
 - "git push origin master"
 - "git push origin HEAD"

To push changes to a new branch (that GitHub will create for you):
 - "git push origin yournewbranchname"

"origin" is just shorthand for the url of the remote repository. You can use it instead of typing "https://github.com/blaa/myrepository.git"

Create a pull request to tell the repo owner that you want to have the commits made to your branch merged into the master branch.

To update the local repository to the latest commit (and merge changes):
 - "git pull"

To merge another branch into your active branch:
 - "git merge <branch>"

Both git pull and git merge will try to auto-merge changes. If there are any conflicts you must manually merge the files shown by git. After changing the files, mark them as merged with "git add <filename>".

Before merging changes you can preview them with:
- "git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>"

To revert local changes:
 - "git checkout -- <filename>"
Changes already added to the index (staging environment), and new files, are kept.

To revert all local changes and commits, fetch the latest from the server, and point your local master branch at it:
 - "git fetch origin"
 - "git reset --hard origin/master"

To delete a file from the repository AND the local file system:
 - "git rm <filename>"

To delete a file from the repository but NOT delete it from the local file system:
 - "git rm --cached <filename>"

Don't forget to commit the staged deletion:
 - git commit -m "Deleted a file"
